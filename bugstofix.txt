FEATURE REQUESTS:

* Check free space before copying a file
* Settings (Show hidden files, Enter boundle on OSX, set editor, move to trash etc.)
* remove path editor from Maemo, there is now use for it, maybe with shortcut
* write help
* implement move functionality for files and directories

TODO:

* add shortcut for bookmark
* add shortcuts for tabs
* the scrolling should move the highlight too
* Show free space on OSX and Linux
* add cancelation to editing
* on OSX execute the boundled directory

FIXED:

* in some media type makes no sense to check free space or it is really slow the refresh rate should be changed -> solved with QFileSystemWatcher
* check shortcut on maemo
* Show free space
* after directory entry nothing is selected and when bookmark is pressed some old path is added
* changing the drive extra slash is added on win
