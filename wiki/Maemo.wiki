= Maemo specific notes =

Due to the smaller screen the UI required some modification. It became fullscreen and therefor got an "Exit" button. It also got an "Open" button to open files or directories, when ".." is selected then it moves one directory upward.
The path editing edit box, has been removed due to lack of space, like the history tab too.
The file list contains one extra line at the bottom which shows the location of the current directory.
